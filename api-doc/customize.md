Customizing the API documentation module
========================================

The API documentation feature is offered by Apigility using the [zf-apigility-documentation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation)
module, written in [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com). This module provide an object
model of all captured documentation information, including:

- All APIs available
- All Services available in each API
- All Operations available in each API
- All required/expected Accept and Content-Type request headers, and expected Content-Type
  response header, for each available API Service Operation
- All configured fields for each service

Moreover, it provides a configurable MVC endpoint for returning documentation:

- documentation will be delivered in a serialized JSON structure by default
- end-users may configure alternate/additional formats via content-negotiation

If you want to customize the format of your API documentation you can have a look at the
source code of the [zf-apigility-documentation-swagger](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger)
module. Basically, you need to create a custom route for your format, e.g. you can see the
Swagger [`module.config.php`](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger/blob/master/config/module.config.php)
, and use the [`ZF\Apigility\Documentation\ApiFactory`](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation/blob/master/src/ApiFactory.php)
to access the data for the API documentation services. The view model to implement needs
to manage a [list](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger/blob/master/view/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger/list.phtml)
view and a [show](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger/blob/master/view/zf-apigility-documentation-swagger/show.phtml)
view, that's it.

All the API documentation formats are driven by *content negotiation* (using the 
[zf-content-negotiation](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-content-negotiation) module).
For instance, to get the API documentation data in Swagger format you can use the content
negotiation `"application/vnd.swagger+json"`.

For example, if you want to retrieve the API documentation data in JSON format you can use
the following request (using [HTTPie](http://httpie.org/)):

```console
http GET http://localhost:8888/apigility/documentation[/api]/[service] 'Accept:application/json'
```

where `[api]` is the name of the API and `[service]` is the name of the REST or RPC service.
To get the same result in Swagger format you can use the following request:

```console
http GET http://localhost:8888/apigility/documentation/[api]/[service] 'Accept:application/vnd.swagger+json'
```
