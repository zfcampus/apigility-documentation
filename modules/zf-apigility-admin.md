Apigility Admin
===============

Introduction
------------

The `zf-apigility-admin` module delivers the backend management API and frontend Admin UI used to
manage APIs in Apigility.

> ### NOTE
>
> **DO NOT** enable this module in production systems.

Requirements
------------
  
Please see the [composer.json](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/tree/master/composer.json) file.

Installation
------------

Run the following `composer` command:

```console
$ composer require --dev "zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin:~1.0-dev"
```

Alternately, manually add the following to your `composer.json`, in the `require` section:

```javascript
"require-dev": {
    "zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin": "~1.0-dev"
}
```

And then run `composer update` to ensure the module is installed.

Finally, add the module name to your project's `config/application.config.php` under the `modules`
key:

```php
return array(
    /* ... */
    'modules' => array(
        /* ... */
        'ZF\Apigility\Admin',
    ),
    /* ... */
);
```

Typically, this module should be used along with
[zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode) in order to conditionally
enable the module in your application. When doing so, you will add the module to your project's
`config/development.config.php.dist` file instead of the `config/application.config.php` file, and
enable it via `php public/index.php development enable`.

Configuration
-------------

There is no custom user level configuration for this module.

Since this particular module is responsible for providing APIs and the Apigility Admin UI, it has a
significant amount of configuration that it requires in order to function in a development
environment. Since it is highly unlikely that developers would need to modify the system-level
configuration, it is omitted in this README, but can be found [within the
repository](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-admin/tree/master/config/module.config.php).

Routes
------

This module exposes HTTP accessible API endpoints and static assets.

API Endpoints
-------------

All routes are prefixed with `/apigility` by default.

### api/config

This endpoint is for examining the application configuration, and providing
overrides of individual values in it. All overrides are written to a single
file, `config/autoload/development.php`; you can override that location in your
configuration via the `zf-configuration.config-file` key.

- `Accept`: `application/json`, `application/vnd.zfcampus.v1.config+json`

  `application/json` will deliver representations as a flat array of key/value pairs,
  with the keys being dot-separated values, just as you would find in INI.

  `application/vnd.zfcampus.v1.config+json` will deliver the configuration as a tree.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`, `application/vnd.zfcampus.v1.config+json`

  `application/json` indicates you are sending key/value pairs, with keys being dot-separated
  values, as you would find in INI files.

  `application/vnd.zfcampus.v1.config+json` indicates you are sending a nested array/object of
  configuration.

- Methods: `GET`, `PATCH`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

### api/config/module?module={module name}

This operates exactly like the `api/config` endpoint, but expects a known
module name. When provided, it allows you to introspect and manipulate the
configuration file for that module.

### api/authentication

This REST endpoint is for creating, updating, and deleting the authentication
configuration for your application. It uses the [authentication
resource](#authentication).

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns an [authentication resource](#authentication) on success.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects an [authentication resource](#authentication) with all details
  necessary for creating new, or updating existing, HTTP authentication.

- HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

  `GET` returns a `404` response if no authentication has previously been setup.
  `POST` will return a `201` response on success. `PATCH` will return a `200`
  response on success. `DELETE` will return a `204` response on success.

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

### api/module/:name/authorization?version=:version

This REST endpoint is for fetching and updating the authorization
configuration for your application. It uses the [authorization
resource](#authorization).

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns an [authorization resource](#authorization) on success.

- Content-Type: `application/json`

  Expects an [authorization resource](#authorization) with all details
  necessary for specifying authorization rules.

- HTTP methods: `GET`, `PUT`

  `GET` will always return an entity; if no configuration existed previously
  for the module, or if any given service at the given version was not listed
  in the configuration, it will provide the default values.

  `PUT` will return a `200` response on success, along with the updated
  entity.

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

### api/db-adapter[/:adapter_name]

This REST endpoint is for creating, updating, and deleting named `Zend\Db`
adapters; it uses the [db-adapter resource](#db-adapter).

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns a [db-adapter resource](#db-adapter) on success.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects [db-adapter resource](#db-adapter) with all details necessary for
  creating or updating a DB connection.

- Collection Methods: `GET`, `POST`

- Resource Methods: `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

### api/module.enable

This endpoint will Apigility-enable (Apigilify?) an existing module.

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns a [Module resource](#module) on success.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects an object with the property "module" describing an existing ZF2 module.

The request payload should hav ethe following structure:

```JSON
{
    "module": "Status"
}
```

### api/validators

This endpoint provides a sorted list of all registered validator plugins; the
use case is for building a drop-down of available plugins when creating an
input filter for a service. Any validator present in the ZF2 `ValidatorPluginManager`
service will be represented.

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns an `application/json` response on success.

- Methods: `GET`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

The response payload for a successful request has the following format:

```JSON
{
  "validators": [
    "list",
    "of",
    "validators"
  ]
}
```

### api/versioning

This endpoint is for adding a new version to an existing API. If no version is
passed in the payload, the version number is simply incremented.

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns a JSON structure on success, an API-Problem payload on error.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects an object with the property "module", providing the name of a ZF2,
  Apigility-enabled module; optionally, a "version" property may also be
  provided to indicate the specific version string to use.


- Methods: `PATCH`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

The request payload should have the following structure:

```JSON
{
    "module": "Status",
    "version": 10

  or a collection of Module resources (when no `name` is provided) on success.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects an object with the property "name" describing the module to create.

- Collection Methods: `GET`, `POST`

- Resource Methods: `GET`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

When creating a new API module, use the following request payload:

```JSON

associated with a given RPC service.

- `Accept`: `application/json`

  Returns either a single [input filter](#inputfilter) (when an
  `input_filter_name` is provided) or a collection of input filters (when no
  `input_filter_name` is provided) on success. Typically, only one input
  filter will be associated with a given RPC service.

  Input filters returned will also compose a property `input_filter_name`,
  which is the identifier for the given input filter.

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

  Expects an [input filter](#inputfilter).

- Collection Methods: `GET`, `POST`

- Resource Methods: `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`

- Errors: `application/problem+json`

### api/module/:name/rest[/:controller_service_name]

return them as well):

- `adapter_name`: A named DB adapter service.
- `table_name`: The database table associated with this service.
- `hydrator_name`: Optional; the name of a hydrator service used to hydrate rows
  returned by the database; defaults to `ArraySerializable`.

The minimum structure for creating a new REST service will appear as follows:

```JSON
{
    "resource_name": "Status"
}
```

API Models
----------

The following is a list of various models either returned via the API endpoints listed above, or
expected for the request bodies.

### authentication

#### HTTP Basic authentication:

```JSON
{
    "accept_schemes": [ "basic" ],
    "realm": "The HTTP authentication realm to use",
    "htpasswd": "path on filesystem to htpasswd file"
}
```

#### HTTP Digest authentication:

```JSON
{
    "accept_schemes": [ "digest" ],
    "realm": "The HTTP authentication realm to use",
    "htdigest": "path on filesystem to htdigest file",
    "nonce_timeout": "integer; seconds",
    "digest_domains": "Space-separated list of URIs under authentication"
}
```

#### OAuth2 authentication:

```JSON
{
    "dsn": "PDO DSN of database containing OAuth2 schema",
    "username": "Username associated with DSN",
    "password": "Password associated with DSN",
    "route_match": "Literal route to match indicating where OAuth2 login/authorization exists"
}
```

### authorization

```JSON
{
    "Rest\Controller\Service\Name::__resource__": {
        "GET": bool,
        "POST": bool,
        "PUT": bool,
        "PATCH": bool,
        "DELETE": bool
    },
    "Rest\Controller\Service\Name::__collection__": {
        "GET": bool,
        "POST": bool,
        "PUT": bool,
        "PATCH": bool,
        "DELETE": bool
    },
    "Rpc\Controller\Service\Name::actionName": {
        "GET": bool,
        "POST": bool,
        "PUT": bool,
        "PATCH": bool,
        "DELETE": bool
    }
}
```

REST services have an entry for each of their entity and collection instances.
RPC services have an entry per action name that is exposed (this will typically
only be one). Each service has a list of HTTP methods, with a flag. A `false`
value indicates that no authorization is required; a `true` value indicates that
authorization is required.

> **Note**: If the `deny_by_default` flag is set in the application, then the
> meaning of the flags is reversed; `true` then means the method is public,
> `false` means it requires authentication.

### db-adapter

```JSON
{
    "adapter_name": "Service name for the DB adapter",
    "database": "Name of the database",
    "driver": "Driver used to make the connection"
}
```

Additionally, any other properties used to create the `Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter`
instance may be composed: e.g., "username", "password", etc.

### inputfilter

```JSON
{
    "input_name": {
        "name": "name of the input; should match key of object",
        "validators": [
            {
                "name": "Name of validator service",
                "options": {
                    "key": "value pairs to specify behavior of validator"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

An input filter may contain any number of inputs, and the format follows that
used by `Zend\InputFilter\Factory` as described in the [Zend Framework 2 input filter documentation]
(http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.input-filter.intro.html).

Currently, we do not allow nesting input filters.

### module

```JSON
{
    "name": "normalized module name",
    "namespace": "PHP namespace of the module",
    "is_vendor": "boolean value indicating whether or not this is a vendor (3rd party) module",
    "versions": [
        "Array",
        "of",
        "available versions"
    ]
}
```

Additionally, the `module` resource composes relational links for [RPC](#rpc)
and [REST](#rest) resources; these use the relations "rpc" and "rest",
respectively.

### rpc

```JSON
{
    "controller_service_name": "name of the controller service; this is the identifier, and required",
    "accept_whitelist": [
        "(Optional)",

        "on individual resources"
    ],
    "route_match": "(Optional) String indicating Segment route to match; defaults to /resource_name[/:route_identifier_name]",

    "table_name": "(Only in DB-Connected resources) Name of database table used for this resource",
    "table_service": "(Only in DB-Connected resources) Name of TableGateway service used for this resource"
}
```

ZF2 Events
----------

### Listeners

#### ZF\Apigility\Admin\Module

This listener is attached to `MvcEvent::EVENT_RENDER` at priority `100`.  It is responsible for
conditionally attaching a listener depending on if the controller service result is that of
an _entity_ or that of a _collection_.  If either is detected, the listener is attached
to the `ZF\Hal\Plugin\Hal` events `renderEntity` and `renderCollection.entity`, which
ensures they will be dispatched when the HAL plugin has an opportunity to start rendering.

ZF2 Services
------------

### Models

Many of the model services provided by `zf-apigility-admin` either deal with the generation and
modification of PHP code, or the generation and modification of PHP based configuration files.

- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\AuthenticationModel` - responsible for creating and modifying the
  authentication specific configuration of HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest and OAuth2 strategies. Sensitive
  information will be written to local configuration files while structural information is
  written to global and module files.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\AuthorizationModelFactory` - responsible for writing the authorization
  specific details (the ACL matrix of allow/disallow rules) to the module configuration file.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\ContentNegotiationModel` - responsible for writing custom
  content-negotiation selectors to the global configuration file.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\ContentNegotiationResource` - REST resource that consumes the
  `ContentNegotiationModel` in order to expose an API endpoint for content-negotiation
  configuration management.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\DbAdapterModel` - responsible for writing database adapter specific
  configuration between application level global and local configuration files. Sensitive
  information is written to local configuration files.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\DbAdapterResource` - REST resource that consumes the `DbAdapterModel`
  in order to expose an API endpoint for database adapter configuration management.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\DbConnectedRestServiceModel` - responsible for writing the required
  configuration information necessary to expose a database table as a REST resource.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\DocumentationModel` - responsible for writing a special named
  file in the module's configuration directory that will contain all custom API documentation
  for requests, responses, and all other documentable elements of an API.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\InputFilterModel` - responsible for writing the input filter
  specification configuration for each module.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\FiltersModel` - responsible for providing, through the API, a list of
  built-in filters and their metadata.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\HydratorsModel` - responsible for configuring and managing the
  global list of hydrator service names.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\ModuleModel` - responsible for aggregating module information including

  a new module, this will create the code artifacts necessary for an Apigility-enabled module.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\ModuleResource` - responsible for exposing the `ModuleModel` as a
  REST resource in the Apigility API.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RestServiceModel` - responsible for presenting REST services, as they
  are defined in `zf-rest` in a way that can be created and modified, to be used in the Admin UI.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RestServiceResource` - responsible for consuming `RestServiceModel` and
  exposing this model as a REST resource in the Apigility API.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RestServiceModelFactory` - responsible for creating `RestServiceModel`s.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RpcServiceModel` - responsible for presenting RPC services, as they are
  defined in `zf-rpc` in a way that can be created and modified, to be used in the Admin UI.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RpcServiceResource` - responsible for consuming `RpcServiceModel`s and
  exposing this model as a REST resource in the Apigility API.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\RpcServiceModelFactory` - responsible for creating `RpcServiceModel`s.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\ValidatorsModel` - responsible for providing, through the API, a list of
  available validators.

  validators provided through, and in conjunction with, the `ValidatorModel` and validator API.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\VersioningModel` - responsible for modeling the workflow and module
  code creation artifacts that are required to provide a new version of a particular Apigility-based
  REST or RPC service.
- `ZF\Apigility\Admin\Model\VersioningModelFactory` - responsible for createing `VersioningModel`s.
