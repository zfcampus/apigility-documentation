Advanced Authentication and Authorization
=========================================

## Modules & Components

Authentication is provided via the `Zend\Authentication` component, authorization via the
`Zend\Permissions` components, and MVC bindings are provided via the
[zf-mvc-auth](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-mvc-auth) module. This module's primary purpose is
to deliver a generalized solution that adds events, services, and models into the Zend Framework 2 MVC
lifecycle that can be utilized to simplify both authentication and authorization.

## Events

In order to acheive integration to the ZF2 MVC lifecycle for authentication, `zf-mvc-auth` wires in
4 listeners that then propagate their own events.  Each of these listeners are registered within the
event `MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE` at different priorities.  This table describes the new event
names:

| `zf-mvc-auth` event | MVC event in which triggered | MVC event priority |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :----------------: |
| `EVENT_AUTHENTICATION` | `EVENT_ROUTE` | 500 |
| `EVENT_AUTHENTICATION_POST` | `EVENT_ROUTE` | 499 |

(The first column are event constants from `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent`; the second are event constants
from `Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent`.)

As you can tell from their priorities, authentication happens *before* routing.  There are
effectively two listeners that deal with authentication related workflows:

- `ZF\MvcAuth\Authentication\DefaultAuthenticationListener` is registered to listen to the event
  `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent::EVENT_AUTHENTICATION`.  This listener is generally responsible for (a)
  determining the kind of authentication that needs to take place, whether it is HTTP Basic, HTTP
  Digest, or OAuth2; and (b) authenticating the provided identity. It then assigns the discovered
  identity (either a `ZF\MvcAuth\AuthenticatedIdentity` on success, or `GuestIdentity` if no
  credentials were provided) to the `MvcAuthEvent`.

- `ZF\MvcAuth\Authentication\DefaultPostAuthenticationListener` is registered to listen to the event
  `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent::EVENT_AUTHENTICATION_POST`.  This listener is responsible for 
  determining if some identity was presented by the client, and if it was successfully
  authenticated. If it was not, this listener will inject a `401 Unauthorized` status code to the
  current HTTP response object and return it, ending the request.

| `zf-mvc-auth` event | MVC event in which triggered | MVC event priority |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------: | :----------------: |
| `EVENT_AUTHORIZATION` | `EVENT_ROUTE` | -600 |
| `EVENT_AUTHORIZATION_POST` | `EVENT_ROUTE` | -601 |

(The first column are event constants from `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent`; the second are event constants
from `Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent`.)

As you can tell from their `EVENT_ROUTE` priorities, authorization happens *after* routing.  There 
are effectively three listeners that deal with authorization related workflows:

- `ZF\MvcAuth\Authorization\DefaultResourceResolverListener` is registered with the event
  `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent::EVENT_AUTHORIZATION` and given a priority of 1000 (executes early).
  This listener is responsible for determining the matched controller service name from the matched
  route, which will later be used for checking against the access control lists.

- `ZF\MvcAuth\Authorization\DefaultAuthorizationListener` is registered with the event
  `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent::EVENT_AUTHORIZATION` with the default priority.  This listener is
  responsible for taking information from the `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent` and determining if the
  identity discovered during authentication is authorized to perform the current request against the
  discovered controller service.

- `ZF\MvcAuth\Authorization\DefaultAuthorizationPostListener` is registered with the
  `ZF\MvcAuth\MvcAuthEvent::EVENT_AUTHORIZATION_POST` event, at default priority.  This listener is
  responsible for checking if the current request is unauthorized, and if so, it will assign a 
  `403 Unauthorized` status to the HTTP response object, and return it.

## Services & Models

The following table describes services and models that are accessible through the Service Manager:

| Service | Class/Interface returned by service |
| :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| api-identity | `ZF\MvcAuth\Identity\IdentityInterface` (either a `GuestIdentity` or an `AuthenticatedIdentity`) |
| authentication | `Zend\Authentication\AuthenticationService` |
| authorization | `ZF\MvcAuth\Authorization\AuthorizationInterface` (likely a `ZF\MvcAuth\Authorization\AclAuthorization` instance, a variant of `Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`) |
