HTTP Digest Configuration
=========================

HTTP Digest authentication provides similar setup requirements to HTTP Basic, and adds the benefit
that passwords are not sent over the network in plain text. The tool used to create a proper digest
file also comes with the [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) installation: `htdigest`. If this tool
is not present on your system, there are a number of web based tools that will also produce a valid
`htpasswd` file; [google for "htdigest generator"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22htdigest+generator%22) for examples.

Like HTTP Basic authentication, a digest file will need to exist before configuration of this 
authentication scheme takes place:

```console
$ htdigest -c data/users.htdigest "Secure API" ralph
Adding password for ralph in realm Secure API
New password:
Re-type new password:
$ 
```

Once the file has been created, its path can be used to configure the required `htdigest` file input 
of the HTTP Digest authentication configuration screen, shown here:

![Configuring HTTP Digest settings](/asset/apigility-documentation/img/auth-authentication-http-digest-ui-settings.jpg)

Like HTTP Basic configuration, sensitive information will be stored in your application's
`config/autoload/local.php` file, while the structure and non-sensitive parts are stored in
`config/autoload/global.php`.  This mean that for this authentication strategy to become part of
your application when it is deployed to production, you will need to provide it a digest file in your
production `config/autoload/local.php` configuration file.

At this point, HTTP Digest authentication has been setup and is ready to use.

```HTTP
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Digest username="ralph", realm="Secure API", nonce="2f3fdb4e7670ae34f0b5c092d720961c", uri="/foo", response="eaaf8d5ac41022635277a4196b747ba1", opaque="e66a41ca5bf6992a5479102cc787bc9", algorithm="MD5", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="c07b87e1b0cc5115"


```

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "foo": "bar"
}
```

And a failed attempt at authentication:

```HTTP
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Digest clearly-invalid-token


```

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{
    "type": "http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html",
    "title": "Unauthorized",
    "status": 401,
    "detail": "Unauthorized"
}
```

Important notes:

- Your client should be capable of properly encoding the HTTP Digest `Authorization` header, and 
  able to fulfill the digest handshake.
- In production, ensure a `htdigest` file can be utilized in the same relative location as in 
  development, even if the `htdigest` was not checked into your VCS.
- No `Authorization` header in the request implies that the "guest" identity will be used.
